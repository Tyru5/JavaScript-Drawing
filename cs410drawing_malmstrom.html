        <p>Behold, Art! (I changed this text).</p>
        <ul id="list">
            <li>
                The animation is quite interesting, yet awesome. I wanted to make my animation as realistic as possible. Therefore instead of showing the ball being 'sucked' into the massive balck hole,
                I show the ball gravitating to what is known as the <em>event horizon</em>. This is essentially the point of no return and once an object, in this case it is the red ball, passes the
                event horizon, nothing, not even <strong>light</strong> can escape the gravitational pull.
                <br/>
                Therefore, to an observer watching the ball 'fall' into the black hole, one would notice that it would freeze in time. After a couple of minutes, the object would begin to turn red and more red (<strong>red shift</strong>) until finally the object seems to disappear.
                <br/>
                In my opinion, black holes are horrifyingly interesting and I would highly recommend watching
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pAnRKD4raY" target="_blank">this</a>
                video to learn and understand more.
              </li>
              <br/>
              <li>
                To replay the animation, click anywhere on the canvas.
              </li>
              <br/>
              <li>
                Also, if you do end up clicking explosion, just refresh the page to make it stop!
              </li>
              <li>
                You can also change the color of the stars and the closer planet by refreshing the page!
              </li>
        </ul>

        <canvas id="dboard" width=600 height=400></canvas>
        <button id="explode" onclick="commands.explosion();">EXPLOSION!</button>
